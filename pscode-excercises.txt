// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

num1=1.5
num2= 6.3
# Add two numbers
sum= num1 + num2
print (The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}' .format (num1, num2, , sum))

Or two numbers someone enters


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num = int (input ("Enter any number to test wheter it is odd or even:"))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print ("The number is even")
else:
    print ("The number is odd")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

numbers_str = input ("Enter numbers seperated by spaces: ")
numbers = [float (num) for num in numbers_str.split()]

total=0;
for x in numbers:
    total= total + x
print ("Average of ", numbers, "is", total/len(numbers))
print ("The maximum is", max(numbers))
print ("The minimum is", min(numbers))
